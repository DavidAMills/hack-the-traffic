# ATX Hack the Traffic

ATX Hack the Traffic is a hackathon series that seeks to use data and technology to solve Austin's transportation challenges. The project is a [City of Austin]() initative carried out in parternship with the [UT Center for Transportation Research]().

Our next event will be at [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/) on June 2nd. Visit our [Open Source Traffic Sensor]() repo for details about the Hack for Change project.
