# ATX Open Source Traffic Sensor
Welcome to the ATX Open Source Traffic Sensor, a [City of Austin]() initative to create a network of traffic sensors built with commodity hardware and open-source software. 

Our goal is to collect traffic data that can inform our efforts to improve all aspects of Austin’s transportation system. A high-density network of traffic sensors will allow us to more closely monitor traffic conditions and will reduce our response time to issues. The data will enable planners to better understand traffic patterns and make data-informed design decisions. The traffic data we collect will also help our engineers identify and mitigate safety issues on roadways. Furthermore, we intend to make the sensor software and collected data publicly available so that research institutions, private companies, and the general public can help us derive new insights about Austin’s transportation system.

We do not have the IT resources to take on this project by ourselves, and commercial data collection solutions are prohibitively expensive. That’s why we’re seeking help from Austin’s incredible community of civic-minded technologists to help us achieve our goal. We believe strongly that, if successful, this project will lead to tangible improvements in Austin’s transportation system, and will represent a truly innovative approach to the deployment of community-driven smart city technologies.
I’ve attached a few photos from our last event. Please let me know what other information we can provide.

We will build a prototype of the sensor at the [ATX Hack for Change]().

Network Architecture + Device Management

This project is a continuation of the work carried out at [ATX Hack the Traffic() and 

Write a vehicle detection program to run on an SBC (single board computer) such as a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, or an Edison. You can use Bluetooth, WiFi, or any other sensor technology that the SBC supports.
